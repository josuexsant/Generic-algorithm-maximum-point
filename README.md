# Generic-algorithm-maximum-point
Generic algorithm to find the maximum point

# Description
This repository is a final project on the subject of distributed computing, the project consists of a genetic algorithm to find the maximum point of a curve, for this we use a client-server architecture where the server sends the curve to be analyzed to the clients and they They compete to give the best result in the shortest time possible
